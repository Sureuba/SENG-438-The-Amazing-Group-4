# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

The aim of exploratory testing is to create "realistic" scenarios that cases the software to succeed or fail it's operation. Since this is an ATM machine, we will simulate a typical user interaction with the ATM machine.

The main scenario consists of **Withdraw, Deposit, Transfer, and Balance Inquiry**. We will test the four functions with the two different cards provided.

For every action, we will also try to cancel the transaction whenever we make a selection and test if the system responds accordingly. Some additional exploratory testing also includes trying to enter the incorrect card number or PIN to see the response. For example:

Scenario 1: User uses **Card 1** to **Withdraw** from **Checking**.<br />
Scenario 2: User uses **Card 1** to **Withdraw** from **Saving**.<br />
etc...

This testing method should be comprehensive enough and will reach most functions for the ATM machine.

    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.
