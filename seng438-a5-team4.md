</br>
From this chart, it can be seen that when MTTF min is halved, the data points go into the rejection (red portion) part of the system

</br>
From this chart, it can be seen that at MTTF min, the data points are in the the continue (yellow portion) part of the system

</br>
</br>

**Double MTTF min**

</br>
From this chart, it can be seen that when MTTF min is doubled, the data points go into the accept (green portion) part of the system
