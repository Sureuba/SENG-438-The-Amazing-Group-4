# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

You can find all the test case references in question 3

1:
Test case - C1 - java.lang.Number[] createNumberArray(double[] data) <br>
Input: double[] data = { 1.0, 2.5, -3.5, 4.5, 0.0 } <br>
The input array is neither null nor empty, which allows all the codes to be exercised and guarantee 100% statement coverage.

2:
Test case - F1 - boolean equal(double[][] a, double[][] b) <br>
Inputs: <br>
double[][] a = { { 1.0, -2.5, 3.5, 0 }, { -5.0, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5 } } <br>
double[][] b = { { 1.0, -2.5, 3.5, 0 }, { -5.0, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5 } } <br>
Two 2D-arrays are not null and have the same contents and length, which allows all the if-statements to be passed and continue to execute the for-loop. Exercising the for-loop covers all the codes and guarantee 100% statement coverage.

3:
Test case - F4 - boolean equal(double[][] a, double[][] b) <br>
Inputs: <br>
double[][] a = null <br>
double[][] b = null <br>
The first array is null so that the if-statement (b == null) can be exercised. This test case can increase the condition coverage.

4:
Test case - void testCtorValues() <br>
Inputs: Range(50,4) <br>
Creating a Range object with mixed up values for the constructor. Instead of low to high the range is created with high to low values. This tested the constructor of the Range class to see if the if-statement inside the constructor works and throws a new illegal argument exception. This increased the branch coverage to 100%, line coverage to 100%, and method coverage to 100%.

5:
Test case - void constiansBothUBandLB () <br>
Inputs: exRange7.contains(1) <br>
This fucnction ensures that we tested the else statement in the contains function. This makes sure that if both upper and lower bound were the same, that value would be contained within the range. It made sure to go into the else statement. This increased the branch coverage to 75%, line coverage to 100%, and method coverage to 100%. Note: The last else statement was impossible to get 100% branch coverage due to the 2 if-statemnts before it.

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report 

One of the coverage tools used was EclEmma. Pros of this tool are that it clearly shows the statements of the class that need to be tested like methods, branches, and statements. All the information is colour coated, and well organized. A con with the EclEmma tool is that you must navigate to the file system to the specific class every time you want to run the coverage tool. This is time consuming and could be visually improved. JaCoCo is another coverage tool we used. A pro of this tool is that it can download a report in the form of an HTML file. A con, is in order to find the details of each method, the whole report needs to be downloaded, otherwise only general coverage can be accessed. 

# 7 A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.

Requirements-based test
Advantage: Requirements-driven test generation guarantees that tests encompass all the designated software requirements, thereby guaranteeing that the system's functionality meet the anticipated standards.
Disadvantage: Requirements-driven test generation might neglect situations not explicitly outlined in the requirements document, consequently resulting in an incomplete coverage of all potential issues.

Coverage-based test
Advantage: Coverage-based test generation can ensure that test cases cover all execution paths of the code, help evaluate the comprehensiveness of the test, and discover potential code defects.
Disadvantage: Coverage-based test generation may ignore some important functional requirements, resulting in the inability to fully test the functionality of the system. Sometimes in order to achieve high coverage, substantial test cases may be generated which increases the cost and complexity of testing.

# 8 A discussion on how the team work/effort was divided and managed
Uruba and Naina worked on the coverage tests, the data flow graph, the def-use sets per statement, DU-pairs per variable, and calculate the DU-Pair coverage for Range Tests. Chuhang and Bill worked on on the coverage tests, the data flow graph, the def-use sets per statement, DU-pairs per variable, and calculate the DU-Pair coverage for Data Utilities. This way two pairs were able to focus on exploring one class thoroughly. We communicated clearly and looked over one another's code to catch each other's mistakes and divided all work evenly. 

# 9 Any difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned from performing the lab

Difficulties: Understanding the different types of coverage can be difficult. It is hard to distinguishing between branch coverage and condition coverage. Sometimes it is necessary to create a large number of test cases to improve overall coverage. However, in many scenarios it is difficult to design corresponding test cases.
What we learned: We use test coverage tools to test coverage to know which parts of code need to design additional test cases to be exercised.

# 10 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

Through the lab, we learned a different technique to white box coverage testing. It allowed us to thoroughly explore how to get more coverage on our tests we previously created. It was time consuming, but the outcome was a great learning experience.
